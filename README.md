# OCS01 Python Test Automator

A Python-based automation script to interact with and test the `ocs01-test` Rust CLI. Instead of manually navigating the interactive menu, this script runs the CLI as a subprocess and automates the testing of all smart contract methods defined in `exec_interface.json`.

This project serves as a practical example of controlling interactive command-line applications using Python, specifically designed for the Octra Labs `ocs01-test` challenge.

## üöÄ Features

-   **Fully Automated**: Runs the Rust CLI and interacts with its menu without user intervention.
-   **Dynamic Test Generation**: Automatically reads `exec_interface.json` to discover and test all available smart contract methods.
-   **Intelligent Parameter Generation**: Creates valid test data for methods, avoiding common errors like division-by-zero.
-   **Configurable Cycles**: Allows setting the number of test cycles and the delay between them for stress and endurance testing.
-   **Robust Interaction**: Uses `pexpect` to reliably control the subprocess, handling prompts and outputs, even with ANSI color codes.

## üìã Prerequisites

-   **Linux or macOS**: The script relies on `pexpect`, which is not available on Windows.
-   **Python 3.6+**
-   The compiled **`ocs01-test` Rust binary** (must be executable).
-   **Required Python libraries**:
    ```bash
    pip install pexpect
    ```

## ‚öôÔ∏è Setup

**install rust (if not installed)**

```bash
curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://sh.rustup.rs | sh
source $HOME/.cargo/env
```

**build from source**

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Dorlinrozin/ocs01-test.git
cd ocs01-test
cargo build --release
```

**Copy json file**

```bash
cp EI/exec_interface.json .
```

**required files in same directory**

-   wallet.json - create with your credentials
-   exec_interface.json - copy from EI/ folder

you need your `wallet.json` file which has your wallet details like the last time in "octra_pre_client" dir
```bash
cd octra_pre_client
```
```bash
cp ./wallet.json ../ocs01-test
cd ../ocs01-test
```
if you can't locate `wallet.json` file, just create one in `ocs01-test` dir
```bash
nano wallet.json
```
copy and edit
```bash
{
  "priv": "PRIVATE_KEY",
  "addr": "ADDRESS",
  "rpc": "https://octra.network"
}
```
press `Ctrl+X`, press `y`, then press `Enter` to save

copy `EI/exec_interface.json` file to `ocs01-test`. use the following command
```bash
cp EI/exec_interface.json .
```

## ‚ñ∂Ô∏è How to Run

Make a Screen
```bash
screen -S automator
```
Execute the Python script:
```bash
python3 menu_automator.py 
```
The script will then prompt you to enter:

1- The number of times you want the test cycle to repeat.
2- The delay (in seconds) between each cycle.

The script will start the automated process, and you will see the interactions logged in your terminal.

After running successfully close from screen with pressing `Ctrl A+D`

## üîß How It Works

The script uses the `pexpect` library to spawn the `ocs01-test` binary as a child process. It then automates the interaction by:
1. **Expecting** specific patterns in the process's output (e.g., `choice:, press enter to continue...`).
2. **Sending** the required inputs (menu numbers, parameters, confirmations) back to the process.
3. Looping through all methods defined in `exec_interface.json` to ensure full test coverage.

This approach allows for robust, automated testing of the interactive CLI without needing to re-implement its core cryptographic or networking logic.
